# FaceTrack Attendance System 🎥🧠

## Project Overview
FaceTrack Attendance System is a real-time face recognition-based attendance application built with Python, OpenCV, and face_recognition.  
It automates the attendance process by detecting and recognizing known faces through a webcam feed and logs the first appearance time of each recognized individual. Unknown faces are detected and flagged separately to ensure security.

## Features
- 📸 Real-time face detection and recognition
- 🧾 Automated attendance marking with timestamps
- 👥 Simultaneous multiple face recognition
- 🚨 Unknown face detection and warning
- 🗂️ Attendance saved in CSV file format
- ✅ Lightweight and efficient UI with live updates

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- face_recognition (based on dlib)
- NumPy
