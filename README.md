# FaceTrack Attendance System 🎥🧠

## Project Overview
FaceTrack Attendance System is a real-time face recognition-based attendance application built with Python, OpenCV, and face_recognition.  
It automates the attendance process by detecting and recognizing known faces through a webcam feed and logs the first appearance time of each recognized individual. Unknown faces are detected and flagged separately to ensure security.

## Features
- 📸 Real-time face detection and recognition
- 🧾 Automated attendance marking with timestamps
- 👥 Simultaneous multiple face recognition
- 🚨 Unknown face detection and warning
- 🗂️ Attendance saved in CSV file format
- ✅ Lightweight and efficient UI with live updates

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- face_recognition (based on dlib)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/FaceTrack-Attendance-System.git
   cd FaceTrack-Attendance-System

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install face_recognition
pip install numpy
```

3. **Prepare known faces**
   
• Place your known face images inside the AttendancePhotos folder.

• Each image filename should be the person's name.

4. **Run the project**

```bash 
python AttendanceProject.py
```

```bash 

### 🧠 Important Tips:
- Make sure the **code blocks** are wrapped with triple backticks ( \`\`\` ) — not single ones.
- Leave a **blank line** before and after the code block and each section title for proper spacing.
- When editing on GitHub, use the **“Preview” tab** to check how it will render.
